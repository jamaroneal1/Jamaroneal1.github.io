            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
            starting from the base of myself. I was born and raised in Cleveland,Ohio.I am striving to start a career that leads to computer science.I've been in the military since 2019 seving in the U.S Army. The reason im pursoing a career in programming is because I always enjoyed how things works. An woundered how exactly I am using these applications. I feel as alot of computer knowledge was in arms reach but yet so far away.I want to be able to grab that knowledge and grow alnog side it. I still want to get to a point were I can show someone my work, an describe to them how it works.Even if they have no clue what i am talking about.
